## RESULTS

1)A graph of wavefunction and exp(−γ ∗ εbρ) as a function of ρ is depected in graph titled exp_wavefunctio.png

• The binding energy found : 2.23 MeV.
• The found point of convergence : 98.413

2)The lamda_vs_rho depicts the relationship between convergence point and the regularization parameter λ.The
general trend is that the convergence point decreases with the increase in λ with fluctuations we speculate. The
following checks and analysis were done to find if there was numerical reason for these fluctuations.

1. Varying the numerical parameters grid size b, and equating it to b=100,b=120,b=150 but the nature of the
graph doesn’t change.

2. Varying the precision parameter ε2 and result only finds convergence points more precisely, but the nature of
the graph doesn’t change.

3. suspecting that Numerov’s method produced pathological results for specific rgularization parameters, the
graphs for parameters where fuclution is observed were visually analysed and after the analysis it was conclude
that were no irregularities in the wavefunction produced.

## Conclusion

The analysis of regularization scheme dependence on the behavior of the wavefunction is done, and the results
convey that the wavefunction for this regularization form tends to its universal form at a very large value of ρ,
counterintuitive to the assumption that for a zero-range potential, the wavefunction tends to the universal form close
to the end of range of the potential. The convergance point for each regularization is found. Although the source
of fluctuations was not found, a general that the convergence point decreases with the increase in λ is establisheds.
